Democrat,pedropierluisi,El Grupo de Trabajo Congresional sobre el Desarrollo Económico de PR extendió el plazo para presentar propuestas hasta el 14 de octubre.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"El éxito requerirá mucho trabajo y sacrificio, pero vale la pena."

Democrat,pedropierluisi,"...estoy convencido de que, actuando dentro los parámetros de PROMESA,  podemos empezar a reencaminar a PR..."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Si la Junta, los líderes electos de PR, los acreedores de PR y los hombres y mujeres talentosos del sector privado trabajan juntos..."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,La Ley PROMESA es una de las legislaciones más importantes sobre el tema de Puerto Rico que el Congreso haya jamás aprobado.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"El siguiente paso es que la Junta nombre un Dir. Ejecutivo y el personal profesional de apoyo, de conformidad con el Artículo 103 de PROMESA"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Agradezco a los 7 nombrados por su buena disposición para servir.

Democrat,pedropierluisi,En mi carta enviada al Gobernador le solicité que su administración debe tomar acción ahora para cumplir con PROMESA https://t.co/ZXQSL8lWry
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Anoche en Congreso, organizado por @HispanicCaucus, recordamos a las víctimas de Orlando. https://t.co/WAxbqw4i46"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Continuaré trabajando junto a nuestros aliados, para garantizar que esta propuesta de
reglamentación esté incluida en la determinación final"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Quiero expresar mi profundo agradecimiento, a los funcionarios de CMS como a su
agencia matriz y al Dpto de Salud y Servicios Humanos de EU."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Esto es positivo ya q los médicos en la Isla recibirán pagos federales más altos por
cada servicio médico q provean a pacientes de Medicare"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Estoy satisfecho q CMS propone ahora aumentar los tres componentes de la fórmula de GPCI “geographic pricing cost index” para médicos en PR
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Tras años de esfuerzos de mi parte los Centros de Servicios Medicare y Medicaid
aumentarán tasas de reembolso para casi 10 mil médicos en PR"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,#PROMESA  https://t.co/xTU5BqoQWC
Democrat,pedropierluisi,#PROMESA ya es ley.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,RT @Metro_PR: @pedropierluisi urge al gobierno a comenzar cumplimiento con disposiciones de #PROMESA. Detalles https://t.co/9XAVI74OOD
Democrat,pedropierluisi,#PROMESA se convertirá en ley en breve. @BarackObama @WhiteHouse @PressSec
Democrat,pedropierluisi,PROMESA pone fin al mito de q PR tiene algún tipo de estatus político especial y beneficioso y revela q desde el 1898 somos un territorio
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Contrario a lo q han dicho algunos políticos en la Isla, PROMESA sí provee un camino claro para que PR descarte su estatus territorial."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Estaré disponible para aclararle a cualquier funcionario del gob local q necesite entender mejor las disposiciones específicas de PROMESA
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"PROMESA va a prevenir temporeramente que los bonistas demanden al Gob de
PR por incumplimiento de contrato si se falla en algunos pagos."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Se espera q Obama firme PROMESA hoy mismo, a horas de q se cumpla la
fecha de pagos a bonistas de múltiples entidades públicas en PR"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"PROMESA provee un camino claro para q PR descarte su estatus territorial
y lo reemplace con un estatus digno y democrático"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Exhorto al Gob de PR a q estudie de cerca PROMESA y se asegure de cumplir con las disposiciones q son efectivas desde q entre en vigor
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Los q queremos lo mejor para PR debemos hacer todo lo q esté a nuestro alcance para q el proceso funcione de forma justa y sin contratiempos
Democrat,pedropierluisi,También reconozco y respeto a muchos otros q también se preocupan por Puerto Rico y q han tenido objeciones de buena fe en cuanto a PROMESA.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Hay muchas personas q quieren ayudar a PR y que trabajaron para lograr la aprobación de PROMESA, por lo q cuentan con mi profunda gratitud."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Mi expectativa es q al menos varios de los miembros de la Junta sean puertorriqueños, de descendencia puertorriqueña o estén vinculados a PR"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Tendré un rol activo en el proceso. Es crítico que los miembros sean personas inteligentes, trabajadoras, justas y conocedoras de PR."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Una vez @POTUS firme esta ley, el próximo paso será seleccionar los 7 miembros que compondrán la Junta."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Estoy convencido de que PROMESA es la mejor alternativa legislativa al grave problema que enfrentan mis constituyentes.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,PROMESA fue aprobado con el apoyo de 68 senadores.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Ahora se están llevando a cabo 3 votaciones relacionadas a Puerto Rico, culminando con votación final sobre PROMESA. https://t.co/C6ahmHmuGc"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"El esfuerzo para q se apruebe PROMESA ha enfrentado grandes retos, pero ya este vital esfuerzo está llegando a su etapa final."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"PROMESA es una legislación imperfecta pero indispensable, q constituye la única alternativa real para prevenir el colapso del Gob de PR"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"El voto de hoy fue un gran éxito, y me siento sumamente satisfecho. Estoy esperanzado de q la votación final será igual o más contundente."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"PROMESA será llevada a votación final, en la q necesitará 51 votos para ser aprobada y enviada al Presidente Obama para su firma."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"La votación de esta mañana obtuvo 68 votos a favor de la moción para cerrar el debate sobre PROMESA, mucho más de los 60 votos requeridos."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,El Senado federal acepta llevar a #PROMESA a votación con 68 a favor y 32 en contra. La medida deberá ser aprobada sin mayor dificultad.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Ante la inminente consideración de PROMESA, envié una carta a todos los senadores de EU explicando la urgencia de q sea realidad el 1/julio"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Exhorto al Senado federal a que  actúe y apruebe el proyecto #PROMESA. Es vital para Puerto Rico.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Al momento, el proyecto se encuentra ante la consideración del Senado y se espera q baje a votación la semana próxima, previo al 1 de julio"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Quiero dejar claro q la oposición a esta legislación está basada en información errónea, en borradores previos y en pura semántica."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,PROMESA le provee a PR un mecanismo amplio para reestructurar la deuda avalado por el Dpto del Tesoro y crea una Junta de Supervisión
Democrat,pedropierluisi,En el foro PR en Crisis expliqué q PROMESA dispone ayudar al Gob de PR a restaurar su salud financiera y recuperar acceso en los mercados
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Da comienzo el foro sobre #PROMESA en Washington, dc Véalo aquí-  https://t.co/Fy2KlBntt4 @amprog"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Hoy a las 10:00 am participaré del foro: PR en Crisis, q realiza el Center for American Progress Action Fund

Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Noten la respuesta de @RepRobBishop con relación a Vieques.
https://t.co/ejx0yFuyw5"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,...y que llegue a manos del Presidente a ser convertida en ley a la mayor brevedad posible.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"PROMESA pasa ahora al Senado, y espero q actúe de la misma manera bipartidista para aprobar esta legislación imperfecta pero indispensable."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"PROMESA provee un mecanismo de reestructuración, en conjunto con la creación de una Junta de Supervisión Fiscal temporera e independiente."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"La semana pasada, la Cámara federal aprobó la Ley para la Supervisión, Administración y Estabilidad Económica de PR o PROMESA."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Uno de los cuerpos del Congreso ya ha actuado.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,El significado práctico es claro: le corresponde únicamente al Congreso otorgarle al Gob de PR la facultad para reestructurar sus deudas.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Por lo tanto, es inconstitucional bajo la Cláusula de Supremacía de la Constitución estadounidense."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Supremo de EU confirmó decisión del Tribunal d Apelaciones del 1er Circuito q la Ley d Quiebra Criolla invade el campo ocupado por el Cap 9.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"A step that is essential if the territory is going to overcome its severe—and worsening—economic, fiscal and demographic crisis"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,The significance of the Court’s holding is crystal clear: only Congress can provide the PR gov with the authority to restructure its debts.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,And therefore is unconstitutional under the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"The Supreme Court, affirmed the July 2015 decision that the PR Public Corporation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act is preempted by Chap. 9"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Saddened by the tragedy and senseless loss of lives in Orlando.My most sincere sympathy to all the families and friends.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Misión cumplida. Con Puerto Rico y con mi conciencia. Aprobada #Promesa
Democrat,pedropierluisi,La votación no ha terminado pero ya se aprobó #Promesa. Va por 275 votos y sólo se necesitan 218.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Cinco minutos ahora para votación FINAL de #Promesa
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Esta última enmienda estará en votación 15 minutos. #PROMESA
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Puerto Rico merece tener democracia plena y dignidad plena—no merece menos.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Puerto Rico tiene que convertirse en un estado para ser un miembro equitativo de la familia estadounidense, lo que es el próximo paso lógico"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Este proyecto de ley es un paso esencial, pero no es la solución duradera."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"...a los posibles litigios, a la deteriorada calidad de vida en PR, y a mayor emigración a los estados."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,PROMESA beneficia los intereses de todos y es la mejor alternativa al caos...
Democrat,pedropierluisi,...los pensionados de los sistemas de retiro sufrirán daños irreparables y muchos bonitas podrían perder sus inversiones.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Sin PROMESA, el Gobierno de PR probablemente colapse..."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"En una emergencia, el primer paso consiste en estabilizar la situación, y creo que PROMESA puede lograr este objetivo."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,La alternativa a esta medida es el caos.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"...y presupuestos balanceados, y que se adhiera a los mismos."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,...a la vez que establece una Junta de Supervisión Independiente y Temporera para asegurar un plan fiscal viable a largo plazo...
Democrat,pedropierluisi,La medida le permitirá a Puerto Rico reestructurar su deuda pública de forma justa y ordenada...
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"PROMESA, es un acuerdo bipartidista dirigido a lidiar con la crisis fiscal sin precedente de Puerto Rico, la cual es severa e inmediata."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Tengan en mente que mis constituyentes pueden montarse en un avión en cualquier momento y mudarse a la Florida o a Tejas.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,...dado que el Gobierno de Puerto Rico busca poder proveerle a los residentes de la Isla una calidad de vida comparable a la de los estados
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Esta falta de disciplina fiscal es lamentable, pero comprensible..."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"En gran parte, para compensar ese trato desigual, el Gob ha gastado más de lo q tiene a nivel local, causando deuda y déficits excesivos."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,...en cuanto a sus derechos democráticos y oportunidades económicas.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Como PR es un territorio, mis constituyentes nunca han sido tratados igual que sus conciudadanos en los estados..."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Yo represento a Puerto Rico en este Congreso, y yo apoyo a PROMESA."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,@Raul_Labrador toma turno favor de #PROMESA
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"@RepJoseSerrano reitera problema principal de PR es el estatus, al anunciar su voto por #PROMESA"

Democrat,pedropierluisi,"@NydiaVelazquez apoya #Promesa. Lo cataloga como ""a tough vote""."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Congresistas Grijalva y Young toman turnos a favor de #Promesa
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Comienza el debate de #PROMESA
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"El debate general comenzará 3:15pm, por una hora. Luego se debatirán 8 enmiendas. Entre 5:30pm y 6pm es la votación. #PROMESA"
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Exhorto a mis colegas a votar a favor de esta legislación
Democrat,pedropierluisi,PROMESA es la mejor oportunidad que tenemos para resolver la crisis fiscal inmediata en PR y lograr que se encamine hacia un mejor futuro.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Casi no hay probabilidad de que esta disposición afecte a algún empleado en PR, ya q el gob local retiene la habilidad de prevenir su uso."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Por ejemplo, la disposición sobre el salario mínimo es desacertada.Apoyo la enmienda de la Congresista Torres para eliminarla del proyecto."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"PROMESA, como cualquier producto de un acuerdo bipartidista, no es perfecta."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Si el Gobierno de PR hace las cosas bien, la Junta tendrá un rol muy limitado y cesará sus operaciones en pocos años."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Alrededor de las 3pm se reanuda la discusión de las enmiendas tras lo cual iniciará el debate general. El voto final será entre 5pm y 6pm.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Luego de intensas negociaciones, el proyecto de ley establece una Junta razonable mucho menos poderosa que la establecida para DC en 1995."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,PROMESA cumple con esa norma.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Mi norma a seguir, desde el 1er día, ha sido que la Junta debe tener la autoridad de supervisar—pero no de ordenar y controlar—al Gob de PR."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,No quiero menos derechos democráticos
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Como un propulsor de la Estadidad para PR, quiero los derechos democráticos plenos para nuestra Isla, a nivel federal y local."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Soy totalmente consciente de la importancia de la democracia y la dignidad.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"Ésta no es una posición realista, y resultaría en que Puerto Rico no reciba ayuda."
Democrat,pedropierluisi,Hay políticos en PR q buscan un mecanismo de reestructuración amplio por parte del Congreso pero se oponen a una Junta de Supervisión.
Democrat,pedropierluisi,"...balancear su presupuesto, convertirse en más eficiente y transparente, y recuperar el acceso a los mercados financieros."
